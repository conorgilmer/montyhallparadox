The monty hall paradox
is about a card game on an american game show from many moons ago hosted by Monty Hall
A contestent is given a choice of 3 cards or doors, behind one of the doors or cards is a prize
when they select a card or door the "computer" removes randomly one door or card which does not have the prize
the contestant is asked to stay with their original choice or change
if they change they have a 2/3s chance of winning but if they stay they have 1/3 chance of winning but people intuitively think sticking with their original choice is better.

Every time i learn a new computer language i try this as a simple programming task.
