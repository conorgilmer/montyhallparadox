#The Month Hall Problem
Our statistical assumptions are incorrect!
Sometimes called the Monty Hall Paradox or the 3 card game problem, from the Monty Hall US game show, "Lets make a deal",  ([Monty Hall Problem (wikipedia article)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem))
It is a small program which I often re-write to learn the basics of a new computer language.
